Welcome to the personal website of Ed Terry. 

You may know me in one of several capacities: 
## Robotics Engineer
I am currently working for L5 Automation, Inc., an early-stage startup with a focus on autonomous strawberry harvesting. I work on the Perception subsystem, which involves implementing the algorithms and behaviors for a robot to understand its environment through the use of cameras. 

## Certified Life Coach
I support people in clarifying, setting and achieving ambitious goals and surmounting the obstacles which get in the way. I have a certification from [Lumia Coach Training](https://www.lumiacoaching.com/) and am taking on new clients. 

## Dancer, DJ, Pianist & Composer
My recent creative expression has taken the form of being both a participant in and DJ for Ecstatic Dance events in multiple cities around the US. I have written and performed original compositions for solo piano and chamber groups.
